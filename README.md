# Life-Expectancy-Rate-prediction
Life Expectancy Rate Prediction using R programming language, Used WHO data from 193 countries &amp; performed Simple Linear Regression. Got R Square = 0.8274 and Adjusted R Square = 0.8248, Divided data into training and testing sets to build predictive model with 90+% accuracy, used visualization tools like ggplot2, histogram, boxplot to analyze relation between target variable (Life Expectancy) and significant predictor variables (Adult Mortality, Infant Deaths, BMI, etc.), Found out mean Life Expectancy across the globe to be 70 years, through hypothesis testing
